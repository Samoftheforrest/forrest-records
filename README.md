### Design

#### Visuals
For this project, I used the pre-made ['Red at Night'](https://colorhub.vercel.app/select-palette/enviro) colour palette from [Daniel Cranney](https://twitter.com/danielcranney)'s ['ColorHub'](https://colorhub.vercel.app/). I decided that to use this colour palette as it is largely monochromatic (using black, grey, and white), but also has a striking red; I believe this colour will attract users' attention toward any calls to action on the site.

![Devhub Colour Pallete](/docs/readme//design/color-palette.png)

The colours used were:
- `#EF4444`: This colour was used as the brand colour, used mostly on call to action buttons/links, or anything else that I wanted to focus the user's attention to.
- `#18181B`: This colour was used as the primary colour for text (on a white background), and to give a contrasting background to some sections. Also, an opaque version of this colour is used on image overlays.
- `#D4D4D8`: This colour was used sparingly either as text decoration or borders - I chose this colour as I felt it is fairly subtle/understated.
- `#F8FAFC`: This colour is used as the primary background colour, and text colour on dark backgrounds.

##### Fonts

I used two [Google fonts]() for this project: [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) for the headings, and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for main body text.

### UX/UI Flowchart

## Features

### Current Features

#### Feature 1: Navigation Bar

![Navigation bar](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav.png)

Allows the user to navigate between the following sections:
- Home
- Shop
- Blog
- Contact
- Login/Register
- Basket

The "Shop", "Login/Register" and "Basket" also have submenus that display on hover:

**Shop submenu**
![Shop menu](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav-menu.png)

**Login submenu**
![Login menu](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav-login.png)

**Basket dropdown**
![Basket dropdown](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav-basket.png)

The basket dropdown also contains:

1. A scroll icon which displays if the dropdown is scrollable.

2. A small quantity icon to show how many items are current in the user's basket.

![Basket quantity](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav-basket-quantity.png)

#### Feature 2: Homepage

![Homepage](/docs/readme/features/homepage.png)

This page displays when the user visits the home directory of the site - meaning that it will be the page that most users see for the first time when visiting. It consists of:
- The navigation bar
- A title
- A lead paragraph
- Two buttons - that lead to the shop and blog

**Social icons**
The social icons, upon the page loading, have a staggered animation in which each item slides up into view - one after another. I achieved this using a SCSS for loop.

```
@for $i from 1 to 5 {
    .homepage-icons a:nth-child(#{$i}) {
        animation-delay: calc(#{$i * 0.25}s);
    }
}
```

It looks like this in the final version of the site:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94783808/190912753-f9f2bdb7-b905-438e-9539-7a35bc4a3a5e.mp4

#### Feature 3: Blog Pages

![Blog page](/docs/readme/features/blog-list.png)

When the user visits the blog area of the site, they are initially directed to the blog listing page - which shows the blogs sorted in order from newest to oldest. Also, from the admin, anyone with the correct permissions can set a 'featured' blog, which will be the first blog to show on this page:

**Featured Blog**
![Featured blog](/docs/readme/features/blog-featured.png)

Once a user clicks the blog of their choice, they are redirected to the page for that individual blog post. This page includes a breadcrumb which allows you to return to the main blog listing page.

**Individual Blog Page**
![Individual blog](/docs/readme/features/blog-single.png)

I also installed an additional pip package - [ckeditor](https://django-ckeditor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - to allow any admin who is writing a blog to do so using a rich text field. I decided to take this approach as I found this way ensured that any formatting present in the blog post was present on the page; it also allowed for authors to include relevant links, images, tables, etc.

**Edit Blog (Admin Page)**
