### Design

#### Visuals
For this project, I used the pre-made ['Red at Night'](https://colorhub.vercel.app/select-palette/enviro) colour palette from [Daniel Cranney](https://twitter.com/danielcranney)'s ['ColorHub'](https://colorhub.vercel.app/). I decided that to use this colour palette as it is largely monochromatic (using black, grey, and white), but also has a striking red; I believe this colour will attract users' attention toward any calls to action on the site.

![Devhub Colour Pallete](/docs/readme//design/color-palette.png)

The colours used were:
- `#EF4444`: This colour was used as the brand colour, used mostly on call to action buttons/links, or anything else that I wanted to focus the user's attention to.
- `#18181B`: This colour was used as the primary colour for text (on a white background), and to give a contrasting background to some sections. Also, an opaque version of this colour is used on image overlays.
- `#D4D4D8`: This colour was used sparingly either as text decoration or borders - I chose this colour as I felt it is fairly subtle/understated.
- `#F8FAFC`: This colour is used as the primary background colour, and text colour on dark backgrounds.

##### Fonts

I used two [Google fonts]() for this project: [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) for the headings, and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for main body text.

## Features

### Current Features

#### Feature 1: Navigation Bar

![Navigation bar](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav.png)

Allows the user to navigate between the following sections:
- Home
- Shop
- Blog
- Contact
- Login/Register
- Basket

The "Shop", "Login/Register" and "Basket" also have submenus that display on hover:

**Shop submenu**
![Shop menu](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav-menu.png)

**Login submenu**
![Login menu](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav-login.png)

**Basket dropdown**
![Basket dropdown](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav-basket.png)

The basket dropdown also contains:

1. A scroll icon which displays if the dropdown is scrollable.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94783808/190649667-eb4d6353-266e-42ad-bd5e-24b55e01170c.mp4

2. A small quantity icon to show how many items are current in the user's basket.

![Basket quantity](/docs/readme/features/feature-nav-basket-quantity.png)

#### Feature 2: Homepage

![Homepage](/docs/readme/features/homepage.png)

This page displays when the user visits the home directory of the site - meaning that it will be the page that most users see for the first time when visiting. It consists of:
- The navigation bar
- A title
- A lead paragraph
- Two buttons - that lead to the shop and blog

**Social icons**
The social icons, upon the page loading, have a staggered animation in which each item slides up into view - one after another. I achieved this using a SCSS for loop.

```
@for $i from 1 to 5 {
    .homepage-icons a:nth-child(#{$i}) {
        animation-delay: calc(#{$i * 0.25}s);
    }
}
```

It looks like this in the final version of the site:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94783808/190912753-f9f2bdb7-b905-438e-9539-7a35bc4a3a5e.mp4

#### Feature 3: Blog Pages

![Blog page](/docs/readme/features/blog-list.png)

When the user visits the blog area of the site, they are initially directed to the blog listing page - which shows the blogs sorted in order from newest to oldest. Also, from the admin, anyone with the correct permissions can set a 'featured' blog, which will be the first blog to show on this page:

**Featured Blog**
![Featured blog](/docs/readme/features/blog-featured.png)

Once a user clicks the blog of their choice, they are redirected to the page for that individual blog post. This page includes a breadcrumb which allows you to return to the main blog listing page.

##### Individual Blog Page
![Individual blog](/docs/readme/features/blog-single.png)

I also installed an additional pip package - [ckeditor](https://django-ckeditor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - to allow any admin who is writing a blog to do so using a rich text field. I decided to take this approach as I found this way ensured that any formatting present in the blog post was present on the page; it also allowed for authors to include relevant links, images, tables, etc.

**Edit Blog (Admin Page)**
![Edit blog](/docs/readme/features/blog-admin.png)

#### Feature 4: Shop pages

![Shop page](/docs/readme/features/shop-page.png)

When the user visits the shop area of the site, they are directed to a list of all products - although it is also possible to navigate to album/merchandise-only pages through the navigation.

**Sale tag**

![Sale tag](/docs/readme/features/shop-sale-item.png)

If an item is on sale (meaning `on_sale=True` in the backend), a red flag displays on the item to reflect this. Also, the new price is shown next to the original price to show the user the deal they are getting.

**Digital download tag**

![Digital download tag](/docs/readme/features/shop-digital-download.png)

If an album is also available for digital download, this is reflected in the products list by the 'digital download available' tag at the bottom of the item - next to the product type.

**Filter**

![Shop filter](/docs/readme/features/shop-filter.png)

On the main shop page, there are options to sort the products based upon certain criteria (e.g. price, name, etc).

Example

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94783808/193417101-ccf8aca8-5f3e-4402-8ae3-7c708a45f6f3.mp4

**Search**

The user is also given the ability to search for items within the shop by clicking the floating search icon in the bottom-right corner of the page. However, on mobile - to free up screen real estate - the search bar is included within the main mobile menu.

Examples

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94783808/193417155-2ab2ad6f-1aa0-4579-9395-8d3299d55a61.mp4

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94783808/193417158-3d08cf78-236e-4223-82dc-1612bfdaa797.mp4

##### Individual Product Pages

Once a user has found the product they wish to view on the main shop page, they can click through into the individual pages, which have the following features:

**Product information**

Merch version

![Merch information](/docs/readme/features/shop-merch-info.png)

Album version

![Album information](/docs/readme/features/shop-album-info.png)

This section shows the following information about the product:
- Name
- Image
- Artist
- Description
- Sizes (if product type is merch)
- Digital download (if product type is album)
- Quantity selector

This section also includes the 'Add to wishlist button'

Example of quantity buttons - including minus button being disabled when quantity reaches 1

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94783808/193417216-dadbc24b-03eb-4289-951e-ef7a96cd49bc.mp4

**Track listing**

![Track listing example](/docs/readme/features/shop-track-listing.png)

On the album pages, the user is also shown the track listing of the album they are currently viewing - ordered by track number. However, if there is no tracklist for this album, the following displays:

![Empty track list example](/docs/readme//features/shop-track-listing-empty.png)

**Related items**

If there are any other products available from the same artist the user is viewing, they will be shown as related products at the bottom of the page. However, this list is limited to four items.

Example

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94783808/193417227-3881e82b-cbb9-4a43-9eb8-1691eaaece4a.mp4

#### Feature 5: Artists Page

![Artists Page](/docs/readme/features/artists-page.png)

From the "Shop" menu in the navigation, the user can also navigate to the Artists page. This page shows a list of all artists on the site, arranged alphabetically. Each artist name is a link that leads the user to a filtered version of the shop page that shows products by the artists they have selected only.

### Features to be Implemented
1. Tours: Add a section to the site which allows user's to search/buy tickets for an artist of their choice's tour.
2. Membership: Add a means for users to sign up for a paid membership, which gives them access to perks such as pre-release sales and free shipping.
3. Featured item on homepage: Add a section to the homepage in which admins can set a featured artist/product/blog.
4. Double albums: Add a double album product type that is similar to an album, but has room for two tracklists.
5. Limited edition tag: Similar to the 'sale' and 'featured' tag - add in another, different colour, tag to show that an album is limited edition/collectable.
6. Individual song pages: allow users to purchase, and see information about, individual songs.
7. Product comments: allow users to add comments on product pages, to leave their feedback.
8. Low stock tag: Add a tag - similar to the 'sale' and 'featured' tags - that let the user know that an item has low stock; this may encourage more sales if the user doesn't wish to miss the chance to purchase the item.
