## Testing User Stories

| User story | Implementation | Test | Result |
| ---- | -------------- | ---- | ------ |
| As a user, I want the site's navigation to be simple and intuitive. | I created a simple navigation by only using six possible links for the general areas of the site: home, shop, blog, contact, login/logout, basket - for the links that have more complexity (e.g. the different products within the shop) I added submenus to the main nav items. | I will ask a test user (my partner) to navigate to three areas within the site - contact, the basket, and merchandise within the store - to see if she can easily navigate to all of these areas on her first try. | Result text |
| As a user, I want to be able to be able to checkout without an account. | When creating the logic/templates for checking out, I included a checkout path that allows a user to checkout without logging in. | I will create my own test account, and attempt to complete the entire checkout process without logging in. | Result text |
| As a user, I want to be able to search for products, to reduce the amount of time it takes to locate a particular product. | On the product pages, I included a search bar that allows the user to search within the shop for a specific item. | I will search for three specific items: a shirt, an album and a digital download. | Result text |

| As a user, I would like to be able to create an account to save/update my delivery information. | I will implement an authorisation system - using allauth - to allow users to login, and to save their data within the User/Userprofile database tables | I will create a test account, and add details for said account - once done, I will logout and attempt to login in again and check that the information has saved and displays properly. | Result text |
| As a user, I would like to be directed to an error page that is inkeeping with the sites design/aesthetic if there is any error. | I have added a redirect for any unrecognised URL or other error to the appropriate 404, 500, etc pages. | I will add three unused URLs to the end of the site's URL: /news, /gigs, /forum and observe whether I am redirected to the appropriate error page. | Result text |

| As a user, I want clear feedback on what is in my shopping bag, including when it is empty. | Within the basket icon - in the main navigation - I have added a number that displays the amount of items in the user's bag. Also, I have added a toast that displays when an item is added, updated, or removed from the basket. | I will add three random products to my basket to test whether the appropriate toasts and number of items display. | Result text |
| As a user, I want to be able to easily update my shopping bag, including removing items from it. | I have added functionality that allows the user to change the quantity of each item in their basket, as well as removing it (either by clicking 'remove' or changing the quantity to 0). | I will select two items that have been added to my basket. One of these items I will update the quantity of, the other I will delete. I will observe whether both of these items have updated correctly. | Result text |
| As a user, I want clear confirmation when an order has been completed. | I have included a template that displays a success message, which the user is redirected to upon successfully completing their order. | Using a test account, I will complete three orders, to see if I am directed to the appropriate template each time. | Result text |
| As a user, I want feedback that my order is being processed. | I have added functionality that emails the user once a transaction has been completed and is being processed | Upon completing three test transactions from the previous user story, I will check that - for each of these transactions - a confirmation email has been sent. | Result text |
| As a user, I would like a page that shows a list of all the artists, so I am able to find relevant products easily. | I have added an 'artists' page, which is accessible through the shop submenu - this template lists all of the artists in alphabetical order. | I will ask a test user (my partner) to locate and visit the page of three random artists, and observe if she is able to find them all simply. | Result text |
